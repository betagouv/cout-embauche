**[Online demo](http://sgmap.github.io/cout-embauche/)**.

If you want to create your own specific interface, have a look at the [API documentation](http://embauche.beta.gouv.fr/api-cotisations-sociales).


Usage

JS API
---

The JS API is exposed in `window.Embauche`.

At the moment, it depends on the widget being present in the DOM to load the configuration from it.

> Please open an issue if you want to consume the API in a different way.


### `window.Embauche.OpenFisca.getLastResults()`

Returns the currently-displayed computed simulation data, as an object containing the OpenFisca-computed values, as identifiers from the OpenFisca [legislation](http://legislation.openfisca.fr) mapped to `Number` values.


### `window.Embauche.OpenFisca.get([additionalParameters], callback)`

Calls the Paie API, parameterised with the current state of the form.

You can adjust the situation to compute by passing an object as the first argument (`additionalParameters`). The parameters you can use are documented in the [Paie API](http://embauche.beta.gouv.fr/api/doc).

This function takes a callback as last argument. This callback will be called with three parameters:

- An optional error. The failed `XMLHttpRequest`, or a `SyntaxError` if the fetched OpenFisca value is not properly formatted.
- An object containing the OpenFisca-computed values, as identifiers from the OpenFisca [legislation](http://legislation.openfisca.fr) mapped to `Number` values.
- The full OpenFisca [response](http://embauche.beta.gouv.fr/api/doc) if you need everything it sends back.

If the callback is not input, returns the OpenFisca `GET` URL to obtain the results, as documented in the [`/formula` API](http://embauche.beta.gouv.fr/api/doc).

#### Example:

```js
window.Embauche.OpenFisca.get({
	zone_revitalisation_rurale: true
}, function(error, results) {
	if (error) throw error;
	window.alert('Employer would pay ' + results.salaire_super_brut + ' if this geographic zone was elected as a ZRR.')
});
```

Build
-----

This widget is packaged with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and distributed through [RawGit CDN](https://rawgit.com).

> RawGit does not offer any guarantees, we will distribute on our own servers when we get enough users to justify the investment.


### Compilation

To compile your modifications, clone this repository, `cd` to it and `npm install`. You can then run `npm run compile` whenever you change a file to update files under `dist`.

Run `npm run dev` to get [webpack's development server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) and visit the ouput url to work on `index.html` with automatic page reloading on source change.

To work directly on a module with automatic page reloading , e.g. the `cout-embauche-widget`, add  `dist/cout-embauche-widget` at the end of the ouput url.


### Distribution

Simply compile the widget and push your changes on GitHub.
